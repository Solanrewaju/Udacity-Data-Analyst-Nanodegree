# Explore Weather Trends- Abuja (Local) vs Global Temperature

## Project Overview
In this project, I analysed data on average temperature in Abuja and globally between 1856 and 2013. The goal of this analysis is *“to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.”*
**SQL** and **Microsoft Excel** was used for this analysis.
### Dataset
The temperature database containing the data is  located on Udacity. There are three tables in the database:
* *city_list* - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database
* *city_data* - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC)
* *global_data* - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC)

## Analysis Process
I used a 5-step analysis process:
1. Question(s)
2. Wrangle
3. Explore
4. Draw Conclusions
5. Communicate

## Summary of Findings
This analysis showed that while the temperature in Abuja is **higher** than the global temperature,  the temperature in Abuja and the globe are **positively correlated** and **increased** within the period of review.
