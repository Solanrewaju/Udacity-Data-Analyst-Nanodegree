    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, I wrangled, analysed and visualised data from the Twitter user- [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as **WeRateDogs**. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs based on pictures or videos with a humorous comment about the dog.<br>\n",
    "These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10! 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because *\"they're good dogs Brent.\"* WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.<br> \n",
    "The **goal** of this project is to <i>'wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.'</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Approach\n",
    "This analysis was done systematically by performing the steps described below\n",
    "1. **Questions:** I reviewed the available data sources and developed analysis questions.\n",
    "2. **Wrangling:** This steps consist of:\n",
    "> *Gathering data* from three sources - csv, tsv and Twitter API.<br>\n",
    "> *Assessing data* visually and programmatically for data quality gaps<br>\n",
    "> *Cleaning data* to address data quality gaps identified<br>\n",
    "3. **Storing data** for easy retrieval of the cleaned data. Cleaning was done using the *define, code and test* approach.\n",
    "4. **Analysing and visualising data** to explore the data, get clarity of the data and get the data story\n",
    "6. **Reporting:** Two reports were created:\n",
    "> * Data wrangling efforts and\n",
    "> * Data analyses and visualizations"

    "## 6.0 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the most popular dog_stage?\n",
    "> The *Pupper* which makes up 63.2% is the most popular dog stage\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What breed of dog have the highest average rating?\n",
    "> *Pembroke* has the highest average rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is there a relationship between rating, retweets, likes and breed of dog?\n",
    "> Retweets and likes are positively correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the best dog across category?\n",
    "> The best dog across category is an **Labrador Retriever**- a doggo with a score of 13/10,  76,281 retweet and 153,977\tlikes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Putting it all together...**\n",
    "\n",
    "After wrangling data from @dog_rates twitter archive, an image prediction file and querying Twitter API, a cleaned dataset consisting of **1,568** original tweets that *rated dogs* was collated. These tweets which rated 111 dog breeds were posted between November 15, 2015 and August 1, 2017. Of the rated dogs, 63.2% are pupper, 24.8% are doggy, 8.1% are puppo while 3.9% are floffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Rating**\n",
    "<br>Rating was done over 10 and it ranged from 2 (Crystal- a Maltese dog) to 14 (a title held by 24 dogs). The highest rated (rating = 14) dog species is Pembroke, closely followed by the Golden Retriever and French BullDog.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Retweets**\n",
    "<br> The tweet with the lowest retweet has 11 retweets while the highest had 76,281 retweets- this was 19,547 retweets more the the second highest retweet (which was tweeted 14 days before it). It was observed that **4/5 of the most retweeted were videos of dogs participating in 'fun' activities  such as standing on water, blowing bubbles in a bowl of water etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Favorite**\n",
    "<br> The least retweeted dog, managed to make it as the least favorited dog (70). A further review of the data shows that the post was made on the second day of the handle's creation. This indicates that the handle probably did not have enough users/reach when the post was made.\n",
    "4/5 of the top 5 retweeted dogs made to the top 5 most favorited dogs. The most retweeted dog maintains a first place with 153,995 favorites (22,677 more favorites over the second position!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the unnamed dog in the tweet - *'Here's a doggo realizing you can stand in a pool. 13/10 enlightened af'* is clearly the MVP. This can be tied to the fact that the tweet includes a video showing a doggo standing comfortable in water- a feat only the brave undertake! Recollect that 4/5 of the most retweeted tweets were videos of dogs in water-related activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you are aiming for high number of retweets for a dog-related tweet, a video of the dog in a water-related activity is a winner."
