# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegre - Projects
*This project were completed to fulfill the requirement for [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) at Udacity.*

## Project Overview

### Explore Weather Trends- Abuja (Local) vs Global Temperature
In this project, I analysed data on average temperature in Abuja and globally between 1856 and 2013. The goal of this analysis is *“to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.”*
**SQL** and **Microsoft Excel** was used for this analysis.

### Investigate a Dataset - Identifying Factors that Predict Missed Appointment Among Patients in Brazil
In this project, I analysed the *[No-show appointments](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv) dataset to identify factors that predicts if a patient will show-up for scheduled appointment.*
**Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** was used for this analysis.

### Analyze A/B Test Results for an e-Commerce Website
In this project, I analysed the data to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The *conversion* or *conversion rate* was chosen as the metric for this analysis. The **goal** is: *to conduct experiment(s) and analyse data to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.*
**Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** was used for this analysis.

### Wrangling and Analyse Data- The Tweet Archives of @dog_rates
In this project, I wrangled, analysed and visualised data from the Twitter user- [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as **WeRateDogs**. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs based on pictures or videos with a humorous comment about the dog.The dogs are rated over 10 although the numerator can be above 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The **goal** of this project is to *'wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.'*
**Python**, **Excel** and **Jupyter Notebook** was used for this analysis.

### Communicate Data Findings - Exploration of Loan Data from Prosper
This analysis explores a data set containing 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
